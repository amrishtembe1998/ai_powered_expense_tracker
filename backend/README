To use Firebase Admin SDK securely, the downloaded service account key JSON file must be converted into a Base64 string and stored in the .env file as SERVICE_ACCOUNT_JSON_BASE64.

✅ Steps (Windows / PowerShell)

Open PowerShell in the directory where your Firebase service account JSON file exists.

Run the following command:

[Convert]::ToBase64String([IO.File]::ReadAllBytes("<file_name>.json"))

Replace <file_name>.json with the actual name of the downloaded Firebase service account file
(for example: serviceAccountKeys.json).

Copy the generated Base64 string and add it to your .env file:

SERVICE_ACCOUNT_JSON_BASE64=PASTE_BASE64_STRING_HERE

⚠️ Important Notes

Ensure the Base64 string is a single line (no line breaks).

Do not wrap the value in quotes.

Never commit the service account file or .env file to version control.
